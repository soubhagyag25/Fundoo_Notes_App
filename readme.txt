Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

Create a Migration:
Run the following command in your terminal to create a new migration file:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-unique-constraint-to-email
This will create a new file in the migrations folder with a timestamped filename.

Modify the Migration File:
Open the newly created migration file, and add the following code to add the unique and not null constraints to the email field:

typescript
Copy code
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.changeColumn('Fundoo Users', 'email', {
      type: Sequelize.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
      unique: true,
    });
  },

  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.changeColumn('Fundoo Users', 'email', {
      type: Sequelize.STRING,
      allowNull: true,
      unique: false,
    });
  }
};
In this code:

The up method is used to apply the changes, adding the not null and unique constraints.
The down method is used to revert the changes if necessary, removing the constraints.
Run the Migration:
Finally, run the migration with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
This will apply the migration to your database, enforcing the unique and not null constraints on the email field.
